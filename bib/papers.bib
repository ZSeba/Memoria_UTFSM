@article{Artz2007,
abstract = {Trust is an integral component in many kinds of human interaction, allowing people to act under uncertainty and with the risk of negative consequences. For example, exchanging money for a service, giving access to your property, and choosing between conflicting sources of information all may utilize some form of trust. In computer science, trust is a widely used term whose definition differs among researchers and application areas. Trust is an essential component of the vision for the Semantic Web, where both new problems and new applications of trust are being studied. This paper gives an overview of existing trust research in computer science and the Semantic Web.},

@article{Marsh1994,
abstract = {Trust is a judgement of unquestionable utility as humans we use it every day of our lives. However, trust has suffered from an imperfect understanding, a plethora of definitions, and informal use in the literature and in everyday life. It is common to say I trust you, but what does that mean? This thesis provides a clarification of trust. We present a formalism for trust which provides us with a tool for precise discussion. The formalism is implementable: it can be embedded in an artificial agent, enabling the agent to make trust-based decisions. Its applicability in the domain of Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) is raised. The thesis presents a testbed populated by simple trusting agents which substantiates the utility of the formalism. The formalism provides a step in the direction of a proper understanding and definition of human trust. A contribution of the thesis is its detailed exploration of the possibilities of future work in the area.},

@article{Schafer2007,
abstract = {One of the potent personalization technologies powering the adaptive web is collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering (CF) is the process of filtering or evaluating items through the opinions of other people. CF technology brings together the opinions of large interconnected communities on the web, supporting filtering of substantial quantities of data. In this chapter we introduce the core concepts of collaborative filtering, its primary uses for users of the adaptive web, the theory and practice of CF algorithms, and design decisions regarding rating systems and acquisition of ratings. We also discuss how to evaluate CF systems, and the evolution of rich interaction interfaces. We close the chapter with discussions of the challenges of privacy particular to a CF recommendation service and important open research questions in the field.},
